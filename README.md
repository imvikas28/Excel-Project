# Creating Dynamic Dashboards in Excel

# Background on Excel

Excel is used a lot for small to medium data exchange and manipulation tasks. While there are more robust or specialized tools available for many specific tasks, Excel is a tool which gets used because it's widely available and generally adaptable to many situations or purposes. This flexibility has benefits and drawbacks. While Excel can be used for a quick list or some data manipulation, failure to follow good data structuring and management principles in Excel can lead to data which are unweildy, difficult to maintain, and difficult to analyze. This exercise demonstrates how to organize and analyze a dataset using named tables, pivot tables, and pivot charts with common controls (called slicers in Excel).
